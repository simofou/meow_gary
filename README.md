gary's web project: a social influence experiment with charitable repercussions

The goal:
create a HTML/CSS/Js website for gary that includes a direct option for donating money to a local charity or shelter.

The idea:
in this day in age, social influencers are all over the websphere. are they real? what do they really do?
this experiment searches to answer these questions by transforming our very own and truly loved "gary" into a world class international super star influencer. and instead of keeping all the money for himself (he's a cat) gary will be donating every penny to a local shelter or charity. 

The how:
how do we donate money? the website. it will include a link to my venmo, paypal or directly to the charity of choice.
how does gary get money? the website. he will have the URL (meow_gary.com) on his collar, and passer-by's will who look closely enough will visit out website, hence donating. 
how much money? cents.
