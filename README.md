<b>gary's web project: a social influence experiment with charitable repercussions</b>

<b>The goal:</b>
create a HTML/CSS/Js website for gary that includes a direct option for donating money to a local charity or shelter.

<b>The idea:</b>
in this day in age, social influencers are all over the websphere. are they real? what do they really do?
this experiment searches to answer these questions by transforming our very own and truly loved "gary" into a world class international super star influencer. and instead of keeping all the money for himself (he's a cat) gary will be donating every penny to a local shelter or charity. 

<b>The shmoney:</b>
- how do we donate money? the website. it will include a link to my venmo, paypal or directly to the charity of choice.
- how does gary get money? the website. he will have the URL (meowgary.com) on his collar, and passer-by's who look closely enough will visit our website, hence donating. 
- how much money? cents. 

<b>The how</b>
1. buy meowgary.com on namecheap.com (it's currently available)
2. host the website on johnny's DIY servers
3. create gmail account gary@meowgary.com > redirects to gary@gmail.com 
4. create paypal business account to link with website
5. build website
6. donate money to charity
7. feel good about yourself
